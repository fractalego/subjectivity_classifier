smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem .
color , musical bounce and warm seas lapping on island shores . and just enough science to send you home thinking .
it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .
a light-hearted french film about the spiritual quest of a fashion model seeking peace of mind while in a love affair with a veterinarian who is a non-practicing jew .
my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .

even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
directed by david twohy with the same great eye for eerie understatement that he brought to pitch black .
it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere .
provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already .

it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable .
hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
extremely well cast , especially in the large number of supporting roles .
a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 .
a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation .
impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .
